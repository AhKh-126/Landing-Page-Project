This is the second project of The odin project (TOP). 
The purpose pf the project is to make a sample webpage and apply all the skills learned so far.
The project uses only HTML and CSS. The approach was to create an HTML home page (index.html) with a structure similar to the sample provided by TOP. After completing the HTML home page, another style file was created (style.css) to style that home page and make it look like the sample picture provided.
As expected the HTML structure was not correct from the first time as there was no style applied to it to be able to have a solid idea how it would look, but by styling every section in the css file it because clear gradually step by step what needed to change. 
This approach was very beneficial to learn the consequences of each approach and idea and how every change affects the other.
It was instructed by TOP that the exact dimensions and sizes didn't matter as long as the given ones were used correctly and the overall look and structure is the same.
Lastly, the picture used was downloaded from this link "https://www.pexels.com/photo/building-photography-2129796/"

Have a great day!
